         * and is preset to a nonsense value like -1 in case a valid invoice was not selected.
         * 
         * clsMainLogic must call one of clsMainLogic.cs's methods to pass in and display the searched for
         * invoice as the search window is closed/hidden.
         * 
         * if clsMainLogic were a static class, I could reference these directly, otherwise, I need
         * a reference passed into wndSearch.xaml.cs then I need to pass that reference along to this
         * class.
